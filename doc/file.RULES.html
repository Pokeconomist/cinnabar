<h2 id="label-A+Game+of+Rocks+and+Minerals-2C+By+Vinson+Brown">A Game of Rocks and Minerals, By Vinson Brown</h2>

<h3 id="label-General+Method+of+Playing">General Method of Playing</h3>

<p>Deal six cards to each of three or more players and place the remaining
cards face down in a reserve pile. The player at the left of the dealer
begins by calling on some player for a card he needs to complete a family
set (of 4 to 5 cards) of which he holds a card. If a player holds the
Copper card (4-D), he may call on another player for Sulphur (4-C), Silver
(4-B), or Gold (4-A). The word COPPER is in large type at the bottom of the
card, and the other minerals of the set or family are in smaller type just
above. If the one called on has the card he gives it to player, who may
continue calling until he fails. Then he draws a card from the reserve
pile. If he draws the card last called for, he may continue to play. If
not, the next person at his left plays. When any player secures a complete
family set, he lays it down. The one having the most sets at the conclusion
of the game is the winner.</p>

<h3 id="label-Crown+set.">Crown set.</h3>

<p>In this game, Family 4 (gold, copper, silver, sulphur) has been designated
as a Crown set, which has been given special play value. In play, anyone
holding all but one of a set may complete it with a Crown Set card. If a
player has three cards of Set 5, he may complete his set with any one of
the Crown Set cards he may acquire. When he has done this, the player who
holds the fourth card of Set 5 gives it to the holder of the completed set,
thus eliminating the card from play. Each Crown Set card may be used but
once in the game.</p>

<h3 id="label-Title+Card.">Title Card.</h3>

<p>The Cinnabar card is given special value. After the cards are distributed,
anyone holding the title card may call its name. All players holding or
later drawing a card of this set must turn it over to the holder of the
title card. If no one has this card at the beginning of play, the first
player drawing it must call it immediately or surrender his right to use it
as a special card.</p>

<h3 id="label-Guess.">Guess.</h3>

<p><em>(Normal play without the special sets)</em> The player calls for a card
from the same family as one of the cards he holds, giving the name of the
rock or mineral he wants. If the opposing player has this card, he must
give it up, and the first player continues to play. If not, he loses his
turn and takes a card from the reserve. Then the next player begins. Again,
the winner is the one getting most sets. A variation of this game is to
have a player show a card with the names hidden of a family asked for and
the other player must guess right name to win it.</p>

<h3 id="label-Give+Away.">Give Away.</h3>

<p>This game is adapted to small children who cannot read, as they only need
to recognize the numbers and letters. This may also be played at school as
no talking is necessary. Two to five may play. Give 5 cards to each player
and place the remaining cards in the reserve pile. After inspecting their
cards, place all leading cards of each set (those numbered 1-A, 2-A, etc.)
in a single even row, face up, on the table so that all players may see
them. Player at left of dealer places one of his cards below same family
group. Player then takes card from reserve pile and next person plays. If
player finds no card in his hand he can place, he draws reserve card and
play passes to next person. If player draws a card with leading number, he
lays it in the row at once, and play passes to next person. First player to
get rid of all his cards wins game.</p>
