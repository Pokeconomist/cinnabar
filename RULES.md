#CINNABAR
##A Game of Rocks and Minerals, By Vinson Brown
###General Method of Playing
Deal six cards to each of three or more players and place the remaining cards face down in a reserve pile. The player at the left of the dealer begins by calling on some player for a card he needs to complete a family set (of 4 to 5 cards) of which he holds a card. If a player holds the Copper card (4-D), he may call on another player for Sulphur (4-C), Silver (4-B), or Gold (4-A). The word COPPER is in large type at the bottom of the card, and the other minerals of the set or family are in smaller type just above. If the one called on has the card he gives it to player, who may continue calling until he fails. Then he draws a card from the reserve pile. If he draws the card last called for, he may continue to play. If not, the next person at his left plays. When any player secures a complete family set, he lays it down. The one having the most sets at the conclusion of the game is the winner. 
###Crown set.
In this game, Family 4 (gold, copper, silver, sulphur) has been designated as a Crown set, which has been given special play value. In
play, anyone holding all but one of a set may complete it with a Crown Set card. If a player has three cards of Set 5, he may complete his set with any one of the Crown Set cards he may
acquire. When he has done this, the player who holds the fourth card of Set 5 gives it to the holder of the completed set, thus eliminating the card from play. Each Crown Set card may be used but once in the game.
###Title Card.
The Cinnabar card is given special value. After the cards are distributed, anyone holding the title card may call its name. All players hlding or later drawing a card of this set must turn it over to the holder of the title card. If no one has this card at the beginning of play, the first player drawing it must call it immediately or surrender his right to use it as a special card.

###Guess.
_(Normal play without the special sets)_
The player calls for a card from the same family as one of the cards he holds, giving the name of the rock or mineral he wants. If the opposing player has this card, he must give it up, and the first player continues to play. If not, he loses his turn and takes a card from the reserve. Then the next player begins. Again, the winner is the one getting most sets. A variation of this game is to have a
player show a card with the names hidden of a family asked for and the other player must guess right name to win it.

###Give Away.
This game is adapted to small children who cannot read, as they only need to recognize the numbers and letters. This may also be played at school as no talking is necessary. Two to five may play. Give 5 cards to each player and place the remaining cards in the reserve pile.  After inspecting their cards, place all leading cards of each set (those numvered 1-A, 2-A, etc.) in a single even row, face up, on the table so that all players may see them. Player at left of dealer places one of his cards below same family group. Player then takes card from reserve pile and next person plays. If player finds no card in his hand he can place, he draws reserve card and play passes to next person. If player draws a card with leading number, he lays it in the row at once, and play passes to next person. First player to get rid of all his cards wins game.
